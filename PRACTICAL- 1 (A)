Kotlin has the basic control structures you’d expect to find in a programming language,
including:
• if/then/else-if/else
• for loops
• try/catch/finally
• while and do..while loops
It also has unique constructs, including:
• when expressions, which are like improved Java switch statements
CODE
Note: After pressing Run Button—Click Run “Main KT”
A) If-else statement
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
var a = 5
var b = 10
if(a > b){
print("Number 5 is larger than 10")
}
else{
println("Number 10 is larger than 5")
}
}
Output:

B) For Loop
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
var numbers = arrayOf(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
for (num in numbers){
if(num%2 == 0){
print("$num ")
}}}
Output:

C) while
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
var number = 1
while(number <= 10) {
println(number)
number++; }}
Output:

D) do-while
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
var number = 6
var factorial = 1
do {
factorial *= number
number--
}while(number > 0)
println("Factorial of 6 is $factorial")
}
Output:

E) when
fun main (args : Array<String>) {
print("Enter the name of heavenly body: ")
var name= readLine()!!.toString()
when(name) {
"Sun" -> print("Sun is a Star")
"Moon" -> print("Moon is a Satellite")
"Earth" -> print("Earth is a planet")
}
}
